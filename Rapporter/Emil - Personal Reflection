Weekly reflection

What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to further deepen my knowledge about Scrum, in order to get a clear picture of how the project will be organized and how to utilise the Scrum framework to its fullest potential. Furthermore, I also would like to know more about the project and its scope. However, it is not possible at this time, as the introductional lecture about this will be held next Wednesday. Hopefully, we will get a interesting project to work with and to further develop our programming skills. On top of that, the project will also help me to develop further skills in cooperation with my teammates and planning and executing a bigger project. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When the project is at its starting pits, the most useful thing I can provide my teammates with is information about Scrum and other topics relating to project work and how to organize projects. As of now, our knowledge about Scrum is scarce, and reading more about this topic and sharing it with my teammates will provide us with a still ground to stand on. Thus, with this mindset, the project can be correctly executed and planned.  
What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As of right now, with the project in its starting pits, the application of scrum has not yet taken place. Therefore, I have not, in that sense, yet contributed to the team’s application of scrum. However, I have shared interesting articles about scrum and the application of it to my teammates in our chat group on Facebook. So, with that in mind, I have indirect contributed to the team’s application of scrum. I have also helped in setting up the github repository, together with my teammates. 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
With this being the first reflection, and thus the first week, I have not yet achieved anything in relation to last week’s ambitions. Therefore, I will skip this part and move on to what I want to achieve next week, together with my learning objectives. 
For next week as learning objectives, I would like to further deepen my knowledge about scrum (as it is of great value to know about in order for the project to be successful), how Github works (for the project to be successful, I want to be able to use the full powers of Github to the project’s advantage) and also get to know our project’s scope (to get a clear picture of what is to come). In order to deepen my knowledge in scrum, I will read as much about it as possible. Furthemore, to learn Github, I will explore the platform as much as I can and seek out the different tools built in the platform. 
As of now, the current situation is that we do not really know what our project’s scope is. However, when that has been clarified, I will try to find out as much as possible about the subject in matter. With that as a solid ground to stand on, I will be more prepared to start the programming part of the project.
