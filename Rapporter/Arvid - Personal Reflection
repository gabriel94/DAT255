what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to work efficiently within a big IT project. I also want to know how to delegate work and to understand which questions to ask. I look forward to understanding how scrum is used in practice. I also want to understand how Github is used in larger projects and how it affects the team dynamic. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help someone else in my group to learn something new by introducing them to new concepts or by sharing my own thoughts on a concept. More specifically, I believe that I can use my IT-skills to help my group work more efficiently by introducing better practices. I will try and keep my mind open to others suggestions.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
We haven’t yet started using scrum in our practice. I have assisted in setting up a github repository for the group. I have also carried a few in group discussions about what scrum could look like within the group.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

Learning objective: to understand the use of scrum in practice better. 

I am very excited about getting to understand scrum in practice. As this is my first learning objective, I don’t have any achievements yet.
