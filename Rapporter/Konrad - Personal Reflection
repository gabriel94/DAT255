what do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently I have a mediocre understanding of SCRUM, and I want to learn and understand it better although I feel like the LEGO-lab was helpful. Until next week I will read the articles from Emil. I would also like to understand the project we are supposed to do, but I guess I’ll have to wait until wednesday to find out more.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not really sure how I can help someone else at this point, since we are just starting out and we are at the same level of knowledge about SCRUM and the rest of the project. I would like to be able to help them later on though and will do it by getting an even better understanding of SCRUM.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I set up the Github repository together with with everyone else. We also took a look at different tools for SCRUM. Next time I want to contribute even more and will do it by being even more prepared before out meeting.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
I had no learning goal from last week, since we just started, but will set one up now. I want to learn more about Github, especially what branches are and will do it by googling. I would also like to get better insight into the project we are about to perform, but I will wait until wednesday for that.
