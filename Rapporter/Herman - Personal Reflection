what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn methods of working, such as scrum. Also I want to better understand how to work in a project concerning IT and mobile applications.
For that I wish to learn new programming softwares and expand my knowledge in this area.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
When we get started with the project we will get a better understanding of everyone's current skills. From there on I can contribute with whatever I feel confident in that
other people in my team are struggling with. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As for now my contribution has been that I've participated in lectures and the LEGO-exercise in order to learn scrum. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As this is the first week I will only set up some goals for the upcoming week. Then I will learn more about GitHub, mostly from googling and self-learning. I have already looked into
some Android Studio stuff to get to know what android application development is like. I will continue with that following an online tutorial along with some 
personal additions.
